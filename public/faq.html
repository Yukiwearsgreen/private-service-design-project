      <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold pb-5">Frequently Asked Questions.</h2>
      <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: What is Cocoon, exactly?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: Cocoon is a sensory-based escape space — part digital, part
          physical, all yours. You choose the lighting, sounds, scent, and
          tactile comforts you need. It’s not therapy. It’s not a wellness app
          yelling at you to breathe. It’s just a pause you get to control.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Is this a mental health tool?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: It supports your nervous system, not diagnoses. Cocoon was designed
          for neurodivergent minds, burnout survivors, overstimulated parents,
          lonely hearts, tired bodies. We’re not replacing therapists. We’re
          offering refuge — the kind you don’t have to explain to anyone.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Do I need special hardware?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: That’s okay. You can start with a preset based on how you feel —
          Overwhelmed Mom Drift, ADHD Focus Field, Programmer Reset, and more.
          Or just try something. You can’t do it wrong. Your nervous system will
          tell you what it likes.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Is this safe for sensory-sensitive users?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: We built Cocoon with sensory diversity in mind. Every sound, scent,
          and visual element is adjustable — or optional. You’re always in
          control. No jump scares, no pop-ups, no sudden noise. Just softness.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Is my data safe?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: Completely. We don’t store your session settings or track your
          activity unless you ask us to. Cocoon isn’t interested in profiling
          you. We’re interested in protecting your space.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Do I need to talk to anyone to use the Cocoon pod?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: Nope. You book your time online. You walk in. The door closes.
          That’s it. No check-in desk, no awkward small talk, no questions
          asked.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: What’s inside the pod?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: A comfy reclining seat or mat, adjustable lighting, built-in sound,
          optional scents, and a weighted or heated blanket. You can customize
          everything through the app before stepping in. It’s a low-stimulation
          space. Think of it like a sensory hug.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: How clean is it?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: We sanitize everything between each session. Linens and blankets
          are freshly rotated, and scent modules are single-use or contact-free.
          You won’t feel the last person’s presence. Just your own.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Can I fall asleep in there?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: Yes. That’s kind of the point. If your session ends and you’re
          still asleep, the system gently fades everything out. Staff will knock
          only if needed after a grace period.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Where can I find a Cocoon pod near me?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: Check the app’s Find a Pod section. We’ve partnered with libraries,
          campuses, and wellness centers. More are coming soon.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Is it accessible?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: We’re working toward full accessibility. Current pods are
          wheelchair-friendly and designed for people with sensory
          sensitivities. Let us know if you have specific needs — we take that
          seriously.
        </p>
        <p class="lead pt-1 mb-4">
          <b>Q: Can I bring someone in with me?</b>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          A: Not yet. Cocoon is a solo experience — deliberately so. But we’re
          exploring tandem pods for paired or caregiver sessions in the future.
